#### Java 8:
- `default` and `public static` methods in Interface. These are concrete methods.
#### Java 9:
- `private static and non-static` methods in Interface. These are concrete methods.
#### Java 10:
- Local Variable Type Inference(LTVI), the `var` datatype helps to figure out the compile-time type for us.
#### Java 11:
- `isBlank()` method in String class returns True if the length of string is zero or contains only whitespace characters.
- `strip()` method in String class is like trim but this supports larger set of white-space characters.
#### Java 12:
- `Enhanced Switch-case` statement to eliminate fall through issue(adding break stmt in every case).
#### Java 13:
- `yield` Keyword to return the result from a switch expression.
#### Java 15:
- `Text Block` for formatting multi-line String literals.
- `formatted()` method for combining String literals with other datatypes in a same statement.
- `indent()` method in String class adds or removes spaces from the beginning of lines in multi-line text.
#### Java 16:
- `Records` create immutable data classes by automatically generating boilerplate code like constructors, getters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods.
Preview feature in Java14 and standardized in Java16.
- Pattern matching for the `instanceof` operator. Ex: `(unknownObject instanceof ScienceFiction syfy)`
